= Simple Demos

This is just a collection of assorted examples that I put together, typically in response to a mailing list query, or for my own curiosity.

== Usage

I tend to use TextMate... so I simply can go to one of the files under spec, for example:

  spec/company_demo.rb

And "run it" 

You could also go to the command line and, from the root directory:
  jonsmac2-2:ssimple_demo jon$ ruby spec/company_demo.rb
